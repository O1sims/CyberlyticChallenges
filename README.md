# Cyberlytic challenges

We posed a number of technical challenges when recruiting new employees. We set challenges in the areas of data science, frontend web development and backend API development. Each challenge should take the candidate anywhere from 4 hours to 8 hours.

The repository provides the challenge questions and example solutions.
